The Search plugin implements the PRG pattern. Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a web development design pattern that prevents some duplicate form submissions, creating a more intuitive interface for user agents (users). PRG supports bookmarks and the refresh button in a predictable way that does not create duplicate form submissions.

The plugin allows you to apply filters on the search as well, for example searching between two dates.

This is **NOT** a search index or search engine! If you look for something like that checkout Elastic Search or Sphinx.
